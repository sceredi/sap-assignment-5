# 5th assignment for the course of Software Architecture and Platforms 2023/2024
## Description
The objective of the assignment is to develop a microservices-based architecture for the EScooters case study, eventually decomposing the monololith proposed in Assignment #3. The proposed solution:

- should adopt at least 2 different technologies for implementing the microservices (e.g., some microservices can be implemented in Vert.x, others in Spring)
- should consider and apply the microservices patterns that appear useful for the case study
- should be properly described and documented
